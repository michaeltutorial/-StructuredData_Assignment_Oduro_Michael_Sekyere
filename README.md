This dataset records my personal expenses over a one-week period. Each row represents a single transaction, with details on the date, category, amount spent, payment method, and a short description of the expense.

Structure Of The Data:
The dataset is structured data, meaning it is organized into clearly defined rows and columns with consistent data types. That is, each observation (transaction) follows the same format, every column has a specific and consistent data type and the data can easily be analyzed using tools like Excel, Python or R.
