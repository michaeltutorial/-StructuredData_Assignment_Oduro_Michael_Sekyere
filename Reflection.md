My dataset is structured because it is divided into well-defined rows and columns, each representing a single transaction with consistent attributes such as date, category, amount,
payment method and description.  Each column has a distinct type of data; dates are formatted uniformly, quantities are numerical, and text boxes represent qualitative information.  
This degree of organization enables the dataset to be easily filtered, sorted, and analyzed using spreadsheet software or programming languages like Python and R.

I had to make sure that all of the dates were in the same format, correct inconsistent spellings (e.g., “Momo” vs. “MoMo”), make sure that there were no blank cells or duplicate 
entries and occasionally recall transactions from memory, which could lead to errors. One of the challenges I encountered when recording the data was remembering to log every 
expense I made in the last few days.

This kind of structured data can be applied in a variety of real world situations.  Apps for budgeting or financial management, for example, use structured transaction data to track
savings, analyze spending patterns and produce insights.  Similar forms are frequently used by businesses to effectively manage spending and track cash flow.

I learned from this activity that a fundamental component of data science is structure.  Analysis becomes unreliable and prone to errors when data is not well organized.  Accuracy is
guaranteed, automation is made possible and significant insights may be confidently and swiftly derived thanks to structured data.
